I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Missouri - Columbia, under the supervision of Prof. Rohit Chadha. I am broadly interested in **formal methods**, **privacy**, and **security**. My research is all about making systems trustworthy: I work to ensure that privacy guarantees are verified, so that users and developers alike can rely on algorithms without blind trust. I aim to push the boundaries of what’s possible while keeping privacy at the core.

I have earned my master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity and a minor in Statistics from the University of Missouri - Columbia.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me hiking through forests, camping under the stars, and exploring the beauty of the natural world. Feel free to reach out at bhusalb@missouri.com. I’m happy to chat, connect and collaborate!
