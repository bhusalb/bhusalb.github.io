I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri - Columbia, under the supervision of Prof. Rohit Chadha. I am broadly interested in **formal methods**, **privacy**, and **security**. Specifically, I am focused on the verification of differential privacy involving Gaussian mechanisms, as well as on privacy-preserving techniques for large language models.

I have earned my master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity and a minor in Statistics from the University of Missouri - Columbia.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and immersing myself in nature. Feel free to reach out at bhusalb@missouri.com. Iâ€™m happy to chat and connect!
