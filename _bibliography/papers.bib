abstract = {We consider the problem of checking the differential privacy of online randomized algorithms that process a stream of inputs and produce outputs corresponding to each input. This paper generalizes an automaton model called DiP automata [10] to describe such algorithms by allowing multiple real-valued storage variables. A DiP automaton is a parametric automaton whose behavior depends on the privacy budget ∈. An automaton A will be said to be differentially private if, for some D, the automaton is D∈-differentially private for all values of ∈ > 0. We identify a precise characterization of the class of all differentially private DiP automata. We show that the problem of determining if a given DiP automaton belongs to this class is PSPACE-complete. Our PSPACE algorithm also computes a value for D when the given automaton is differentially private. The algorithm has been implemented, and experiments demonstrating its effectiveness are presented.},
